# FastFourierTransform
To detect underground nuclear activity, we will employ the use of the Fourier Transform. The Fourier Transform is a mathematical tool that allows signals to be decomposed into their constituent frequencies. In the case of seismic data, this means that the vibrations of the Earth caused by underground nuclear explosions can be analyzed to determine their frequencies.
By analyzing the frequency content of seismic signals, it is possible to differentiate between natural earthquakes and man-made explosions, such as those caused by underground nuclear testing. This is because the frequency content of seismic signals generated by nuclear explosions is different from that of natural earthquakes.
To use the Fourier Transform to detect underground nuclear activity, seismic data must first be collected using a network of seismometers located around the world. The seismic data is then processed using the Fourier Transform to identify the frequency content of the signals
